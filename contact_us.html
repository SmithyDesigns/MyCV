            <p>
                Hello World!
                <br>
                <br>
                I am <b>Willie Moolman</b>. I have completed my Bachelors degree in
                Marketing. I am also busy with Software Engineering Bootcamp at HyperionDev.
                <br>
                Technology is one of my many passions but what makes technology so interesting is how <b><em>Technology</em></b>
                makes the lives of people so much easier, as well as make the world accessible by just a click of a button
                <br>
                <br>
                I can work under pressure and handle tough situations with ease.
                The thing I most like to do is to travel around the world.
                I am a highly motivated and goal-oriented Marketing Graduate.
                I am comfortable working independently and in a team environment.
                I have developed a deep understanding of communication with all stakeholders and focusing efforts achieving daily goals
                I have learnt to manage and mentor people in the work environment which is one of my great passions.
                <br>
                <br>
                Love every second that I am behind a computer coding, building websites or even just doing some research on a coding topic or problem.
                My ideal position one day would be a <b>System</b> or <b>Solutions Architect</b>.
                With the ultimate goal of starting my own <em>Consulting Company</em>.
